# Sample TODO App 

This project is a full-stack app I decided to make, in order to make a resume for myself. Recently, I have started learning [Flutter](http://flutter.dev) and I worked on being better at backend development using [Django](https://djangoproject.com). So I decided to make this app to showcase my abilities in both sides. 

## Phases 

### Phase 1 - Basic Designs of the app 

1. Using Django for the backend 
2. Using MySQL/MariaDB for the data base. 
3. Using Flutter as the frontend. 

### Phase 2 - Backend 

1. Python is the programming language. 
2. Django is the main framework. 
3. Using DRF(or Django ReST Framework) to create an API 
4. Using JWT in order to authenticate users. 

### Phase 3 - UI Design 

_SOME ADOBE XD DESINGS WILL BE HERE_ 

### Phase 3 - Frontend 

1. Mobile app using flutter
2. Make the app communicate with the API using `http` library for the Dart programming lanugage.
